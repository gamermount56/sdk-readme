# Examples

We provide a set of example scenes which demonstrate various ways to use the SDK. These range from simply dumping out raw data to a small puzzle game using Coding tiles. Explore, mangle, and poke at these to your heart's content.

## 1. Basic Example
`Examples/BasicExample/BasicExampleScene.unity`

A simple example of dumping out values seen by the computer vision to screen. Swap out the Deck of the `TangibleManager` on the scene to use different types of tiles.

In our `Update()` call of `Tangible.SDKExamples.BasicExample.Game` you will see we use the current `AliveObjects` list pulled from the singleton instance of `TangibleManager`.

## 2. Basic Numbers
`Examples/BasicSetupExample/BasicSetupScene.unity`

In this example, we subscribe to the events `OnObjectEnter` and `OnObjectExit` from the `TangibleManager`. In the case of subtraction, we also register for the event `OnLocationChanged` because we need to order by X position when tiles move (even if no new tiles enter or exit the play area)

## 3. Basic Words
`Examples/BasicWords/BasicWordsScene.unity`

An example of a game which only registers with `OnObjectEnter`. Once a letter has been detected, the game treats it as guessed. `OnObjectExit` is ignored because letters cannot be unguessed.

## 4. Timeline Game
`Examples/TimelineGame/TimelineScene.unity`

An example game using domino codes. It uses a custom deck (which ignores domino code values that are not used by the game). To play this on device, print out a set of domino codes from `dominocodes.pdf` in the `Readme` directory of the SDK.

In order to make your own custom decks, see the [Customizing Deck](#customizing-decks) section.

## 5. Coding Painting
`Examples/CodingPainting/CodingPaintingScene.unity`

See the [Testing In-Editor](#testing-in-editor) section for how to play in-editor with Coding tiles.

The game of life, using coding tiles to seed different species on the board.

This game uses Coding tiles, and the `ClusterManager`. It uses the most simple decision of what cluster to use by always choosing the largest one.

The `ClusterManager` subscribes to the `OnUpdatedTangibleObjects` event which fires an event every time the computer vision returns with a new set of data. The rate at which this happens is not the same as your Unity update rate. Itâ€™s generally 10-20 times per second on a newer iPad.

See `CodingClusterService` for how the game decides what is in a cluster and what is not.

## 6. Coding Valley
`Examples/CodingValley/CodingValleyScene.unity`

See the [Testing In-Editor](#testing-in-editor) section for how to play in-editor with Coding tiles.

An example of a more complete small puzzle game using the Coding tiles.

## 7. Example Selector
`Examples/ExampleSelector/ExampleSelectorScene.unity`

Use this scene if you want to select between the above example scenes.

NOTE: If you want to switch between different decks at runtime, let us know. We can give you examples of how to do this properly. This Example Selector is a dumb picker and will only load scenes so it does not swap back/forth between different decks at runtime. Close the app to select a new scene.

In order to have this work, you will need to add all of the scenes in your `File -> Build Settings -> Scenes in Build` list.
