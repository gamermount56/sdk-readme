# Available Vision Support

The SDK supports several Osmo standard decks of physical pieces:
  - Words - upper and lower case letters, red and blue, shipped with the Words game.
  - Numbers - digits and dice faces, shipped with the Numbers game.
  - Coding - the various tiles shipped with Coding Awbie and Coding Jam (currently the character pieces with Coding Duo are not supported)
  - DominoCodes - printable barcodes, convenient to prototype new games [(printable link)](./dominocodes.pdf).

NOTE: We only support using a single deck at a time (so the SDK will not be able to detect both Words and Numbers tiles at the same time).

## Customizing Decks

+ Currently, you cannot mix and match tiles from different sets.

If you want to change what tiles are detected (such as if you only care about BLUE letter tiles, or if you are using only certain Domino Codes) you can create a custom deck.

In Unity, in your menu bar select `Assets -> Create -> OsmoDecks`. You will see each type of base Deck that we support.

Select the deck type you want to start with.

### Add-Ons
You may attach any number of `ScriptableObject`s to a deck and have their `Init` and `Destroy` methods called when the Deck is created and destroyed.

For more on `ScriptableObject`, see the [Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/ScriptableObject.html) and [tutorial](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/modules/beginner/live-training-archive/scriptable-objects).
